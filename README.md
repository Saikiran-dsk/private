Hi Carissa,

I hope you're doing well.

I came across Java Full Stack opportunities at DTCC on the Dice job board, including both full-time and contract positions. Since you previously mentioned that there isn’t a budget for an offshore team, I wanted to check if there’s any possibility for me to align with any of these roles.

I am fully flexible with US time zones and open to remote work or an on-site position in Hyderabad. Additionally, I am open to freelancing, direct contract-to-hire in the US, or any other suitable engagement—all while continuing my current role.

Please let me know if there’s any possibility to explore these opportunities while ensuring my commitments here remain unaffected. I would appreciate your guidance on this.

Looking forward to your thoughts.
