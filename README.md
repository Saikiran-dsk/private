Subject: Concern Regarding Conversion Offer

Dear [HR/Manager’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to express my disappointment regarding the conversion process. I joined on a contract-to-hire basis with a certain package, and now, after completing six months, the conversion offer being presented is nearly half of my current compensation, which is even lower than my previous package before joining this role.

Throughout this period, I have repeatedly inquired about the full-time conversion, and every time, I was assured that things were on track. Based on discussions with HR, the company’s reputation, and the expectations set, I genuinely believed this would be the right place for me. Because of this, I chose not to consider other opportunities I had at the time, some of which offered similar compensation to my contract role. Looking back, I feel that not exploring those options was a mistake on my part.

To add to this, my discussion with HR has been disheartening. Instead of addressing my concerns, I was simply told, "This is the offer we are giving—what is your decision?" without any willingness to discuss or reconsider. After investing my time, efforts, and trust in this role, such a response makes me feel undervalued and ignored.

If this is the final decision, then I must say DTCC has significantly impacted my career and left me in one of the most difficult situations of my professional life. I had trusted this role to be a step forward, but this has instead turned into a major setback.

I would still appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further and understand if there is any scope for reconsideration. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
